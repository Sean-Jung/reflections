How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made fixing bugs a lot easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could be able to see through changes in files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is more managable to save manually, but you can miss out a few points.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They have different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can compare commit ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always go back to previous bug-free states.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
